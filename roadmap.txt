🚀 DataOps Assistant Enhancement Roadmap

✅ COMPLETED
- App is now fully async: All routes converted, supports 10–20+ concurrent requests

🎯 REMAINING GOALS

2️⃣ MinIO Integration
    - Store pipeline artifacts (code, specs, results) in MinIO buckets
    - Add endpoints for artifact retrieval
    - Implement versioning for pipeline files

3️⃣ Enhanced Dockerization
    - Multi-stage Docker builds for improved performance
    - Add health checks & monitoring
    - Production-ready container configuration
    - Resource limits & security hardening

4️⃣ Airflow Integration
    - Generate Airflow DAGs from chat requests
    - Auto-deploy DAGs when scheduling is requested
    - Integrate Airflow API for pipeline monitoring
    - Create scheduling interface in chat

📋 Additional Suggestions

Performance & Monitoring
    - Request rate limiting
    - Redis caching for frequent queries
    - Async request logging middleware
    - Performance monitoring dashboards

Advanced Features
    - WebSocket support for real-time pipeline updates
    - Background task processing for long operations
    - Pipeline artifact management via MinIO
    - Enhanced error handling & retry mechanisms

Production Readiness
    - Load testing to determine concurrent limits
    - Database connection pool optimization
    - Security enhancements (authentication, authorization)
    - API documentation improvements

🔝 Priority Order: MinIO → Enhanced Docker → Airflow → Performance Monitoring
